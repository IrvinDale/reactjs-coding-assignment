# reactjs-coding-assignment

### Objective

Using JavaScript and React, this assignment is to implement a responsive signup form to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.
Both a mobile and a desktop version of the design are available to work to.

-   Implemented assignment using:
    -   Language: **JavaScript**
    -   Framework: **React**
-   Your users should be able to:
    -   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
    -   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    -   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
        -   Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
        -   The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_
-   You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
-   There is also a `style-guide.md` file, containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### First time run the project

- Install all libraries required: 
    - npm install

- Run Client
    - npm start
